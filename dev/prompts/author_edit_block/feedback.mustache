The previously provided *edit blocks* had some issues when we used them to make
changes. Here is the feedback we received:

{{{feedback}}}

{{#hasUserGuidance}}
If additional work is needed based on the user guidance, follow the user
guidance to do so by providing new *edit blocks*, otherwise just say "OK".
{{/hasUserGuidance}}
{{^hasUserGuidance}}
Please analyze what was wrong with some of the previous *edit blocks*, consider
the feedback and provide new *edit blocks* accordingly that fix whatever failed.

Hint 1: If the feedback notes that applying edit blocks failed, take a look at the
current state of the relevant code via the {{{retrieveCodeContextFunctionName}}}
tool or the {{{bulkSearchRepositoryFunctionName}}} tool.

Hint 2: If the feedback notes that applying edit blocks failed, and the edit
block that failed isn't your first one for that file since the beginning or the
last test run, it's possible that applying the previous edit blocks changed the
file in a way that made the later edit blocks fail to match. We'd only want to
provide the rest of the edit blocks in this case, i.e. the one that failed and
everything after, and omit the previous ones which we can infer were applied
successfully.

Hint 3: If the feedback includes test results, that indicates that all previous
edit blocks have already been applied successfully. If you want to make further
changes to portions of functions you've already edited, it may be helpful to
see the current state of the relevant code via the {{{retrieveCodeContextFunctionName}}} tool.

Hint 4: If you see errors that include a filepath and line number, use the
{{{bulkReadFileFunctionName}}} tool to see what's going on at those lines.

Hint 5: If an error indicates that a function/type/symbol doesn't exist, find
what actual function needs to be used via tools or ask for help. Do not create
it unless the original instructions mention doing that, as it is likely to be a
hallucination.

Hint 6: If it seems like the edit failed saying it's not in chat history, but
you think it is, then try creating multiple smaller edit blocks, one per
function or import section etc.
